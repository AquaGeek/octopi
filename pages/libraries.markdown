## API Implementations ##

Libraries for accessing the GitHub API from your favorite language

### Python ###

[Dustin Sallings'][dustin] [py-github][py-github] project was the
first third-party implementation of the v1 API and is tracking the v2
API in a branch as new API endpoints are published.

### Ruby - Version 1 API ###

The [github-control][github-control] library is currently doing work 
using the v1 API. The aim is to build a library which others can build on top of. 

It currently has features which need to be enabled on the v2 API as they were in pre-release when developed. 

The [github-party][gh-party] library is also using the v1 API.

### Perl - Version 2 API ###

The [Net::GitHub][net-perl-github] library for Perl encapsulates much of the functionality of the GitHub v2 API.  You can also download it from [CPAN][net-perl-cpan].
